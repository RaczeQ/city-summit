tab2.markdown("""
To generate the visualization, app downloads buildings for a given city from the [Overture Maps](https://overturemaps.org/) dataset.

After downloading the buildings, all geometries are projected to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Coordinate Reference System and their vertices are translated, so that the centroid of a building is at a point (0,0).
              
Optionally, the buildings are also rotated around the centroid, so that the minimum rotated rectangle is equal to the bounding box of a geometry. This operation "straightens" the buildings so that the edges of buildings are aligned with each other.
              
Next, the rasterization operation is applied to a whole dataset. All geometries are stacked on top of each other creating a heightmap.
              
Last operation is plotting the created hightmap as a 3D surface plot. The heighmap data is scaled logarithmically, to accentuate bigger buildings.

This website is written as a Streamlit app and utilizes the following libraries:
              
- [OvertureMaestro](https://github.com/kraina-ai/overturemaestro) - for downloading Overture Maps data for a given city and for geocoding the string to a geometry.
- [GeoPandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas) - for geospatial operations on a dataset of downloaded buildings and I/O.
- [Shapely](https://github.com/shapely/shapely) - for rotations and translations of a building geometry.
- [Rasterio](https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio) - for rastering the buildings dataset into a heightmap.
- [Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) - for displaying 3D surface plot using heightmap data.
- [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) - for 2D array (heightmap) manipulation.
- [PyPalettes](https://github.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/pypalettes) - for easy access to many palletes.
- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) - for transforming palettes.
